\subsubsection{Previous work}
A large part of this project follows on from \cite{lobster-thesis}. In his work, Abdallah created a dataset consisting of images and features of lobsters. The lobsters were measured and categorised and segmentation and feature extraction techniques were applied to create a more diverse dataset with baseline results.  Additionally, classification and regression techniques were used to both classify the category of the lobster (juvenile or mature) and predict the carapace length.

This project is a continuation of Abdallah's work 

\subsubsection{Human pose recognition}
The use of graphs in human pose estimation has been studied in the past
\cite{human-pose} \cite{human-skeleton} where labelled nodes that represent important features such as hands and head are used to build skeleton models. 
\subsubsection{Cattle identification}
