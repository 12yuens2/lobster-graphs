*** Look at edit distance based metric
- weighted edited so that adding/removing weight from an edge counts as an edit in the distance metric
- Removing nodes/edges also counts to edit distance
- https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs10044-008-0141-y.pdf

*** Transform graph to metric space
- Gromovâ€“Hausdorff
- Similar graphs give similar values
- Each node with edges it is connected to and their weights

*** Lobster graph as undirected tree
- Undirected tree is a tree where root is not known
- An undirected graph with no cycles is an undirected tree
- An find less computationally complex algorithm for undirected tree distance rather than graph distance

*** GUI tool to draw graphs and export to .dot files
- d3.js 
- networkx

*** Human pose graph matching papers
- Good ideas that have been tried or bad ones to avoid
- 

* Week 4
** Before meetings
*** Human pose graph matching http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.592.4170&rep=rep1&type=pdf
- Graph matching algorithm used: Algorithm for error-tolerant subgraph isomorphism detection http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=682179
- Store database of model graphs. Graph matching algorithm could return multiple matches from database because it only looks at topology
- Decision trees used to further filter matches. Example graphs are created for decision to learn. 

*** Graph creation software
- Gephi to draw graphs, it can export drawn graphs into a number of data formats.
