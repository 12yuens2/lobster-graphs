*** Look at edit distance based metric
- weighted edited so that adding/removing weight from an edge counts as an edit in the distance metric
- Removing nodes/edges also counts to edit distance

*** Transform graph to metric space
- Gromovâ€“Hausdorff
- Similar graphs give similar values
- Each node with edges it is connected to and their weights

*** Lobster graph as undirected tree
- Undirected tree is a tree where root is not known
- An undirected graph with no cycles is an undirected tree
- An find less computationally complex algorithm for undirected tree distance rather than graph distance

*** GUI tool to draw graphs and export to .dot files
- d3.js 
- networkx

*** Human pose graph matching papers
- Good ideas that have been tried or bad ones to avoid
-
