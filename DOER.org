* Description



* Objectives
** Primary objectives
1. How to represent the lobsters as a graph. Which parts are the vertices, what do the distances between the vertices mean and do we look at the angles between vertices.
   - How complex or simple
   - Too many vertices makes the problem too complex (from computational complexity)
   - Evaluation from matching on lobsters to see which graph structures may be better suited

2. Assuming given two graphs, can we find the difference
   - Using existing software, create graphs of lobsters and do the comparison
   - if similar lobsters give small matching distance
   - what happens if some vertices or errors exist

3. Automatically detect interest points from the images
   - evaluate different algorithms
   - How the matching would change due to errors from creating the graph from computer vision

4. Evaluate against given dataset
   - Evaluate against last project (as a baseline)


** Secondary objectives
- Extending existing or coming up with new algorithm for creating graphs from images, knowing what we've learned so far
- Try on more complex images such as natural lobsters in environment 
- See if this could more for video/real time instead of images

** Any extra objectives


* Ethics


* Resources
